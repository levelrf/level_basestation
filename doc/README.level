This block allows for 2-way communication between the CC1101 and the USRP, using TI's 'SimpliciTI' packet protocol
Switching to the CC1110 will allow more customization on the node

Use SmartRF studio to test, important options:

F_center: 434 MHz
Modulation: 2-FSK
Channel no: 0
Data Rate: 2.4kBaud

Receive with B100

SimpliciTI format:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| preamble | sync | length | dest. address | src address | port | device info | transaction ID | payload | FCS |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Sink listens for a preamble of length 30 bits:
10101010...
If found, look for 32 bit sync word:
1101...
If valid, look at length and store rest of packet in buffer
Then compute FCS code to check for bit errors
If valid packet, segment buffer in to fields
Pass extracted payload to higher level process
