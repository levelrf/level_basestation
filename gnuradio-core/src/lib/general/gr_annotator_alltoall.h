 * \brief All-to-all stream annotator testing block. FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
 *
 * This block creates tags to be sent downstream every 10,000 items it sees. The
 * tags contain the name and ID of the instantiated block, use "seq" as a key,
 * and have a counter that increments by 1 for every tag produced that is used
 * as the tag's value. The tags are propagated using the all-to-all policy.
 *
 * It also stores a copy of all tags it sees flow past it. These tags can be
 * recalled externally with the data() member.
 *
 * This block is only meant for testing and showing how to use the tags.
